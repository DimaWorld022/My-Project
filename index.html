<p> Melting ice is the cause of another of the greatest long-term threats posed by climate change: rising sea level. The deep freezes of Greenland and west Antarctica store enough water to raise the oceans by 20 feet. That would flood many of the world's greatest cities from New York to Shanghai, but remains for now a distant prospect.</p>
<pre> <p> The famous Snows of Kilimanjaro that cap Africa's highest mountain are melting so fast they could be gone within two decades, according to a study of the mountain's ice fields that used data going back nearly a century.

Scientists believe global warming rather than local weather changes is chiefly to blame for the rapid loss of ice from the Tanzanian peak.

A study comparing new measurements with those taken in 2000 show that a layer of ice between six and 17 feet thick has vanished from the summit since that time.

Not only are the mountain's glaciers retreating at an unprecedented rate, but its remaining ice is thinning.

The researchers predict that if current conditions persist, the mountain could be ice-free as early as 2022.

The Snows of Kilimanjaro will then exist only as a memory â€” and the title of a short story by Ernest Hemingway.

Scientists made their forecast after combining data from aerial photographs and ground measurements of ice thickness.

They found that the total area of Kilimanjaro's ice fields had shrunk by nearly 85% between 1912 and 2007. More than a quarter of the ice present in 2000 was now gone. </p>
